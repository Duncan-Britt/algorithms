* Algorithms
As of Fall 2023 I'm taking Algorithms at CU Boulder. This repository is a showcase of my implementations of the algorithms we are studying.

*** Problem
You have three batteries, with capacities of 40, 25, and 16 Ah (Amp-hours), respectively. The 25 and 16-Ah batteries are fully charged (containing 25 Ah and 16 Ah, respectively), while the 40-Ah battery is empty, with 0 Ah. You have a battery transfer device which has a “source” battery position and a “target” battery position. When you place two batteries in the device, it instantaneously transfers as many Ah from the source battery to the target battery as possible. Thus, this device stops the transfer either when the source battery has no Ah remaining or when the destination battery is fully charged (whichever comes first).

But battery transfers aren’t free! The battery device is also hooked up to your phone by bluetooth, and automat- ically charges you a number of dollars equal to however many Ah it just transfered.

The goal in this problem is to determine whether there exists a sequence of transfers that leaves exactly 10 Ah either in the 25-Ah battery or the 16-Ah battery, and if so, how little money you can spend to get this result.

** [[A-Star/grid.c][A*]]
I originally wrote this implementation of A* to run on an Arduino, well before taking Algorithms, but I thought I should include it here. Writing for arduino influenced my design choices. For instance, I minimized memory consumption by bitmasking the occupancy grid.
